###  COMPARISON OPERATORS

At the most basic level, you can evaluate two variables using a comparison operator to return a true or false value. when we using the comparation oprator with  multi values we should use the parentheses that to assign the values to all variables.

COMPARISON OPERATORS :
1. ``` 
> , < , <=, >=, ==,===
```
2. for the logical operator  
```
&& , || , !
```

## if statment :
that we have condation that we need to check if that true or false so the result depend on the condation output

```
if (score>= 50) { 
msg = 'Congratulations!';
msg += ' Proceed to the next round . ' ; }
var el = document.getElementByld('answer ' ) ;
el .textContent = msg;
```

## loops:

we have two loop statment  in the JS the first one is For loop and the another  is while loop

``` 
for (initalize ; condation ;counter)
{
    if the condation ture i will do the statment if it not i will check the condation again 
}
```

while:

```
inatial values

  while (condations)
  {
      statment....
      update counter
  }

  ```
