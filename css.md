### What is CSS?
1. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
2. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
3. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
3. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

### CSS Solved a Big Problem
HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

```
<h1>This is a heading</h1>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

When tags like font, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!

### ACCORDION:
>When you click on the title of an accordion, its corresponding panel expands to reveal the content.
The items contain:
• A visible label ``` (in this example, it is a <button>)
```
• A hidden panel holding the content ``` (a <div>)
```
>
### TABBED PANEL:
When you click on one of the tabs, its corresponding panel is shown. Tabbed panels look a little like index cards.
You should be able to see all of
the tabs, but:
• Only one tab should look active.
• Only the panel that corresponds to the act ive tab should be shown (all other panels should be hidden).
