## what is A SCRIPT?
it is *series of intractions* that the computer follow it in *order* to do somthing 
>
>
to write your code you should achieve your goal that the computer can do more than one instraction at the same time it is follow the  orders in step to achieve the goal so the correct steps to write the code should be as follow :
1. define the goal
2. design the script by deviding to steps
3. code each step

after we deign the flowchart that every step should be writing in that way the computer understand it :
-Vocabulary: The words that computers understand
-Syntax: How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow

#####rules to giving a variable a name:
1. The name must begin with a letter.
2. should not contain a spical charecter .
3. we can not use the instractions to make the names .
4. All variables are case sensitive.
5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.

what is the ARRAYS?
 it is a variable had a list of values related to each other 
 
 You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var keyword followed by the name of the array) for example:
 
```
var colors;
colors ['white', 'black', ' custom '];
var el document.getElementByld('col ors');
el . textContent = col ors[O];
```

Each item in an array is automatically given a number called an index. This can be used to access specific items in the array and the index value start from zero.also we can access and change the value of any itme in the array.

#### EXPRESSIONS :
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions

#### OPERATORS:
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
##### ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:

#### STRING OPERATOR 
There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.
