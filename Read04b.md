the computers every where in our cars , homes our pockets, street etc.... , the computer is a tool that the humens bulit it, to helping them in more complex things like solving equations that the computers do that i n for steps :
1. get the inputs
2. store the informations
3. process the data
4. give the result

that the compyter have input and output ports and storage that the place use it to save the data and the point is we should understand **the software is contrrolled the hardware**.

the language that the computer using called machine language it is using the 0 and 1 to process all data this *0 or 1* called a **BIT** these bits moving by electrcity signals inside the computer throught the wires that is mean if we have more wires that we can process  more BITs and it will make a complex data these system using the 0,1 called a binar system all information can be representive by 0,1.
